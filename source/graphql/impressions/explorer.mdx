## Overview

The `Explorer` component located in the request panel helps you in building queries more flexibly in the `Playground` through a pre-populated schema.

## How the Explorer works

1. Enter a GraphQL endpoint into the URL bar. If you don't have one, click the `Sample` button to add a sample endpoint.
2. As you do, the `Explorer` will fetch the schema and populate the list with queries, mutations, and subscriptions you can perform.
3. Next, scroll down the list in the `Explorer` and select the checkboxes for items you want in your query.
4. As you select items, the query will auto-build in the `Playground` making debugging more accurate.
5. When the query is complete, click the `Send` button to execute it.


`Explorer` is a great feature for you to build and test your GraphQL API more confidently.
