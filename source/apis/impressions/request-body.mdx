- **Raw**
To send anything written as text, you can make use of the Raw body type. Select one of the following from the `Quick Body Type Selection` section or the dropdown list in the `Body` tab and Firecamp will add relevant headers to your request.
  - TEXT
  - JSON
  - XML

## Add Multiple Bodies

Firecamp is all about easing developer's work. Hence, instead of creating two requests with different bodies. You can can just create one request with multiple bodies in Firecamp.

> For example: If you like to test your APIs error response with 200/500/302 error code, then instead of having 3 different requests. You can replicate the same response based on 3 request bodies in one request.

To add multiple bodies in your request, click the `+` icon on the right side of the `Body` tab and enter a name for the new `body` in the dialog box that opens. Press the `Enter` key to add the body when finished.

This feature was designed with accessibility in mind to help developers switch through popular methods faster and check the response in real-time.
