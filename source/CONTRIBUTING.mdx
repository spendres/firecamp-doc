# Contributing to Firecamp

Great!! We are always on the lookout for more folks to help us out over at the campsite in building Firecamp.

Firstly, if you are unsure or afraid of anything, just ask or submit the issue or pull request anyways. You won't be yelled at for giving your best effort. The worst that can happen is that you'll be politely asked to change something. We appreciate any sort of contributions and don't want a wall of rules to get in the way of that.

However, for those individuals who want a bit more guidance on the best way to contribute to the project, read on. This document will cover all the points we're looking for in your contributions, raising your chances of quickly merging or addressing your contributions.

You are welcome to contribute in any way you can and all the help provided is very much appreciated.

- [Raise issues to request new functionality, fix documentation or for reporting bugs.](https://github.com/firecampapp/Firecamp/issues)
- [Submit changes to improve documentation.](https://github.com/firecampapp/firecamp-doc/)

There are a few simple guidelines that you need to follow before providing your hacks.
